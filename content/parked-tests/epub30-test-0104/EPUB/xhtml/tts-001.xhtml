    		<h1>Text-to-Speech</h1>
    		
    		<p>This section contains tests for enhanced text-to-speech support in content documents.</p>
    		<p>These tests are to be conducted using native text-to-speech capabilities of the reading system (whether
    			internal voicing abilities or an integrated screen reader, like VoiceOver for iBooks). The tests
    			should not be run against standalone screen readers, such as Jaws or NVDA.</p>
    		<p>Note that many of the tests in this section intentionally vocalize test words as completely different words
    			to simplify verification that a technology is supported.</p>

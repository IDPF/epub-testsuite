				<span class="test-id">flow-020</span> Continuously-Scrolled Flow</h2>
			<p class="desc">Tests whether setting the global <code>rendition:flow</code> property to <code>scrolled-continuous</code> results in
				a continously scrolling interface.</p>
			<p class="eval">If the content of this publication is preesnted as one continuous scrolling document, the test passes.</p>
			<p class="conditional">Note: Some reading systems allow readers to manually change from the flow (e.g., from dynamically
				paginated to scrolled). Do not use these settings for this test. To pass, the reading system must adapt to the specified flow.</p>

		<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and 
			Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove 
			right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.</p>
		<p>A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary 
			regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly 
			into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts 
			it is an almost unorthographic life.</p>
		<p>One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave 
			for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were 
			thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind 
			Text didnâ€™t listen.</p>

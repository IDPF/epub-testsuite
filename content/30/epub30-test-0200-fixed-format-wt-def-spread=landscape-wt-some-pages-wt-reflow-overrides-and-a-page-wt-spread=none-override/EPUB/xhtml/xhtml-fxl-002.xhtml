				<span class="test-id">xhtml-010</span>0200 fixed format wt def spread=landscape wt some pages wt reflow overrides and a page wt spread=none override</h2>
			<p class="desc">Tests that when the fixed format opf properties are set to orientation=landscape, pages 3 and 6 are overriden as reflowable, and page 8 has page-spread=none, the pages render correctly.</p>
			<p class="eval">When the reading device is  held with a landscape orientation, all the pages should display in landscape mode, with contiguous two page spreads each showing two pages. Page 8 has a page-spread=none override, so it should be on the left, and Page 9 on the right.</p>
			<p>When the reading device is held with a portrait orientation, all the pages should display in portrait mode.  The pages should be numbered sequentially and displayed individually.</p>
			<p>In both device orientations, Page 3 should contain a fragment of Moby Dick in 'reflowable' mode, so you should be able to change the font size via an available font size control.  Page 6 should display several pages of Moby Dick, so there should be both a font size control and a scroll bar available.</p>

		<p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of 
			spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in 
			this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.</p>
		<p>I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, 
			that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present 
			moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
		<p>When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the 
			upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into 
			the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, 
			as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the 
			buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable 
			forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image.</p>

		<h1>Introduction</h1>
        
        <p>This book has been prepared to test reading systems' capability to play EPUBs that feature media overlays. It uses a fixed layout and specifies its own custom highlight style (yellow background and black foreground). Media overlays are associated with the middle chapters only. This means that the first chapter (this one) and last chapter do not have associated media overlays.</p>

    		<p>This section contains tests that check the ability to access components of the EPUB Navigation Document and follow
    			the content links.</p>
    		<p>Note: the table of contents that appeared prior to this section is an example of inclusion in the spine by a content
    			author. When evaluating access to the components of the navigation document, the ability to navigate back to the
    			previous document does not count as a success for any of the tests.</p>

    			<h2>About this Document</h2>
    			
	    		<p>This document focuses on content fragment identifiers used within the content 
	    			of a publication both to link intra- and inter- publication. A future version
	    			may test the ability to share bookmarks, highlights and other features that can
	    			benefit from the use of this linking scheme, at such time as there is standardization
	    			of implementation of the features.</p>
